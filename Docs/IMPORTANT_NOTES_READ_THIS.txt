IMPORTANT PROJECT NOTES - DO NOT DELETE!!!

Data Collection Info:
- Forest inventory conducted in September 2024
- All measurements in European temperate forest sites
- DBH measured at 1.3m height (standard breast height)
- Age estimated from increment cores (not exact!)

Known Issues:
- Plot P003 had some missing canopy measurements - estimated from nearby plots
- Environmental data file name has "backup_old" but it's actually the most recent version (ignore the name!)
- Some tree heights might be overestimated due to measurement technique

Analysis Goals:
1. Calculate total basal area per plot
2. Assess species diversity patterns
3. Examine relationships between environmental variables and forest structure
4. Create publication-quality figures for the manuscript

File Organization TODO:
- Need to create proper folder structure (Data/Input, Data/Processed, Outputs/Figures)
- Scripts should be organized in an R/ folder
- All file paths need to be made portable (currently hardcoded for John's laptop)

Collaboration Notes:
- Sarah will work on improving the visualization code
- Mike is handling data processing improvements
- Emma will restructure the main analysis script
- We need to coordinate on updating the README together

CRITICAL: Before submitting, make sure:
- Version control is set up properly
- All paths use here::here()
- No absolute paths remain
- Proper .gitignore is in place
- All team members have committed their changes
